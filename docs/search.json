It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and applied researchers in many fields.\n\nBenefits of R\n\nflexible and freely available to the public, who have in turn written many user-contributed packages which provide additional functionality.\nRStudio is a convenient interface for R that adds convenient features, such as exporting output in nice formats.\nIn this class, we’ll be doing all of our computation in RStudio.\n\nLet’s begin by installing R and RStudio. First, we need to install R, which can be downloaded here (see screenshot below).\n\nNext, install RStudio Desktop, which can be downloaded here (see screenshot below)."

    "text": "First Steps in RStudio\nWith R and RStudio installed, we’ll begin by exploring RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Upon opening RStudio, you should see something similar to the window below:\n\nThe console is the panel on the left side, and is where users can type commands and see immediate output. Let’s try it out! Type the following code into the console:\n\n3 + 5\n\nYou should get output that looks like\n\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n(For now, ignore the [1]). By typing in 3+5, we got the expected answer, 8. We can see that R can be used as a calculator directly in the console. Try some other commands that use R as a calculator. For instance, 3*25, exp(2), or (10+5^2)/sqrt(40). Of course, R is not simply a calculator; other commands may also be entered here.\nTo illustrate, let’s load a dataset. Enter the following command into the console (you can directly copy/paste it, but make sure everything is exactly as below):\n\n# temporary\ncdc &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n\n# what it should eventually be once I get the website up\n# cdc &lt;- read.csv(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n\nWe’ve just loaded a dataset named cdc. These data come primarily from the Sortable Risk Factors and Health Indicators dataset from the CDC, which omprises demographic and health indices compiled from various federal sources. This dataset is now part of our environment, which is displayed on the top half and right side of the RStudio window.\n\nThe environment contains all objects in the current working space. These objects could be variables, lists of variables, or even entire datasets.\nIn the same location as the environment tab, the **history tab displays all commands used during the current session (don’t worry about the connections tab for now).\nFinally, the bottom half of the right-hand panel shows information regarding files on your hard drive, installed packages, output such as plots, and help files or other documents.\n\nComing back to the dataset we loaded in, we can see that it is named cdc. We can take a look at this dataset in a spreadsheet-like window by clicking on cdc in the Environment tab to the right, or by running the following code in the console:\n\nView(cdc)\n\nNote that other objects may be added to the environment, either from external data sources from the internet as in today’s example, datasets downloaded to your computer, or even as created as manipulations of existing datasets."

    "text": "Quarto and reproducible research\nQuarto is a system that may be used to create easy-to-write, attractive reports, presentations, or webpsages that also serve as reproducible records of the data analysis. These reports have the desirable property of being able to not only display written narratives and figures, but also include any R code and the outputs from these code snippets.\nOne of the biggest strengths of Quarto is that everything is in one place, and that other users should be able to reproduce your results exactly, if they have your Quarto document and datasets - the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render the document. As well, formatting is easy! Luckily, RStudio already comes with Quarto support, so there is nothing additional to install.\nEvery homework assignment and lab in this class will be written in Quarto, with a template provided for you to use. This lab’s template can be downloaded by typing in the following code:\n\ndownload.file(\"https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/lab-01-template.Rmd\", destfile=\"C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/lab-01-template.Rmd\")\n\n## UNC\n\n# download.file(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv/labs/lab-01-template.qmd\", destfile=\"C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/lab-01-template-test.qmd\")\n\nYou should now see the new file lab-01.qmd under the Files tab in the bottom-right hand side of your RStudio window. Click on lab-01.qmd in this window in order to open it up – it is the template for use in this lab!\nFirst, put your name in the space at the top where it says “YOUR NAME GOES HERE”.\nFill in answers in the spaces provided: text narrative should be typed directly in the document and any included R code should be typed inside “chunks,” or sections defined by three backticks (the little mark on the same key as the tilde). See the template for more instructions, or ask your TA.\nAn important thing to note is that the workspace of the Quarto document is separate from the console – this means that you must load any packages inside of R chunks if you want to use functions contained in them. In the template for this lab, this has been done already, but in the future you may have to do it yourself.\nIn order to turn this template into a shareable document, Render the quarto template into an HTML document by pressing the Render button at the top of the document (it is a large blue arrow facing the right). You should see the template rendered as an .html file!"

    "section": "The tidyverse",
    "text": "The tidyverse\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the biggest strengths of R is its large userbase who have contributed user-written functions to R via packages. R packages are “add-ons” to the basic functions available in R (think of them as apps on a phone).\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages designed around a common grammar and data structure. Some packages in the tidyverse that we will be using throughout this semester will be ggplot2, used for creating graphics and figures, and dplyr and tidyr, used for data manipulation and wrangling.\n\nFirst, install the tidyverse package by running the following code in your R Studio console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nAfter installing the tidyverse package, you never have to install it again – all that is needed to use functions from the tidyverse is to load the package once per R session using the following code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nRemember that the console and the Quarto document have different workspaces. If you load the tidyverse package in your console, it won’t be loaded into the workspace for the Quarto document. In the lab template, code for loading the tidyverse has already been provided. However, note that you must have the package installed first."

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo = FALSE.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
