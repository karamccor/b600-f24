## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

-   Initial data analysis approach that summarizes main characteristics of dataset
-   Often visual or in the form of basic summary statistics

## Data visualization

-   The creation and study of the visual representation of data
-   Many tools available (R is popular; many systems within R for data visualization)
-   Creating visualizations helps us see patterns and identify potential data quality issues
-   We will focus on **ggplot2**, a component of the **tidyverse**

## ggplot2 in tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The tidyverse is a group of R packages designed for data science
-   All tidyverse packages share an underlying design philosophy
-   Data visualization package in the tidyverse
-   Inspired by *The Grammar of Graphics* (Wilkinson)

## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

-   A system allowing for concise description of graphical components

![](images/lec-2/gg.png){width="300"}

## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

A statistical graphic is

-   data (which may be statistically summarized or transformed)
-   **mapped** to **aesthetic** attributes (color, size, xy-position, etc.)
-   using **geometries** (points, lines, bars, etc.)
-   mapped onto a specific **coordinate** and/or **facet** system

# Types of data

## Categorical data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Nominal data

-   Named categories without numeric meaning
-   Ex: Only two categories: binary or dichotomous
-   Ex: breast cancer status, blood type, health insurance provider type, education level, etc
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal data

-   Ordered categories, but differences between values not easily measured
-   Relative comparisons made about differences between levels
-   Stage of colon cancer, Likert scale, frequency of smoking (often, sometimes, rarely, never), etc.
:::
:::

## Numerical data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Count or rank data

-   Discrete counts. Or ranks.
-   Number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past week, numerical rank of cancers by mortality, etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Continuous data

-   Measurable quantities where difference between possible values can be arbitrarily small
-   Data may lie within a range or be unbounded
-   Birth weight, BMI, ppm ozone, etc.
:::
:::

## Identifying data types

![](images/lec-2/tab1.png){width="850"}

## Complications

In designing a study, what variable should we use for smoking exposure?

-   Binary variable yes/no?
-   Ordinal current/former/never smoker?
-   Discrete number of cigarettes smoked in past week?
-   Continuous measurement of lifetime pack-years?

In the real world, decisions are made based on sample size, statistical power, likelihood of measurement error, or simply convenience (this happens a lot!)

## Visualizing CDC data

Let's take a look at some basic visualizations using state-level data collected by CDC. We'll examine the following variables:

-   State (categorical; nominal)
-   HDI (categorical; ordinal)
-   Region (categorical; nominal)
-   Adult obesity % (numerical; continuous)
-   Adequate aerobic activity % (numerical; continuous)

## Bar charts

```{r}
cdc <- read.csv("https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")

# write.csv(cdc, "C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")
```

::: columns

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
ggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Region)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(title = "Number of US States by Census Region", 
       x = "Region", y = "Count") + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 28))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
ggplot(data = cdc[1:4,], aes(x = State, y = Obesity, group = 1)) +

  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Obesity by State", 
       x = "State", y = "Adult Obesity (%)")+ 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 28))

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes numerical variable (most often used across time)
-   Each value on x-axis corresponds to only one measurement on y-axis (and vice versa)
-   Often used to depict change over time and connected with line.

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Exercise, y = Obesity)) +

  facet_grid(. ~ HDI) +
  ggtitle("Adequate aerobic activity \n associated with lower obesity") +
  xlab("Adequate aerobic activity (%)") + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 28),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Shows relationship between multiple continuous measurements

-   You can add color, shape, transparency, etc to further differentiate by category
:::

## Some best practices

-   Keep it simple
-   Summarize and highlight
-   Tell a story with the plot (use "active titles")
-   If possible, replace text with visuals

## Reminder: the population vs. a sample {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Population and research question**: Is the PCV13 vaccine effective against community acquired pneumonia in **adults aged 65 or older**?

-   Sample: 84,496 adults 65 years of age or older recruited in a trial between September 2008 and January 2010 and 101 sites throughout the Netherlands.

## Parameters and statistics

**Statistics**

-   Attribute of a sample
-   Function of the observed values at hand
-   Confusingly, both the function and the values
    -   Example: You take a measurement from a sample of 100 people. The mean measurement of that sample (as a function) is a statistic. The actual realized value of the mean measurement of that sample is also a statistic.
-   Written in Roman letters

## Parameters and statistics

**Parameters**

-   Attribute of the population of interest
-   Not computable directly (unless entire population is perfectly measured)
-   Written in Greek letters

A statistic used to estimate a population parameter is an **estimator**

## Numerical summary statistics {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Population **parameter** of interest: vaccine efficacy among all adults aged 65 or older

-   Sample **statistic** collected: proportion of vaccinated adults in the trial who became ill with community-acquired pneumonia
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/lec-2/poly.png)
:::
:::

## Mean {.smaller}

-   **Sample mean**: the arithmetic average of values in the sample:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}(x_1 + \ldots + x_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$

-   Population mean $\mu$ is calculated the same way, but would involve sum over every observation in the population (rarely possible!)

-   The sample mean is a **point estimate** of the population mean

-   Not the exact population mean (unless lucky), but for a representative sample, it's a pretty good guess

-   As the sample size gets larger, on average $\bar{x}$ gets closer and closer to $\mu$

## Median

-   **Sample median**: the $50^{th}$ **percentile**

-   Middle number of observations after being ranked in numerical order

-   For odd number observations, it is the exact middle value; otherwise, it is the arithmetic average of the middle two.

-   Example: What is the median of $\{3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9\}$ ?

-   More **robust** to extreme values or outliers when compared to the mean.

## Mode

-   **Sample mode**: the most frequent value in the dataset
-   There does not only have to be one mode (we can have bimodal or trimodal or other **multimodal** distributions)
-   Example: What is the mode of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 9\}$?

## Are point estimates of location enough?

![](images/lec-2/irma.png){width="700"}

## Skewness

```{r}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Simulate data from a normal distribution
normal_data <- rnorm(400, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Transform the data to make it right-skewed
right_skewed_data <- exp(normal_data)

# Create a histogram
hist(right_skewed_data, breaks = 30,
     col = "darkgoldenrod3", main = " ", 
     xlab = "Value")
```

**Skewed** distributions are not symmetric; they can be right or left skewed depending on which side the "tail" is on.

## Minimum, maximum, and range

-   **Sample minimum** and **maximum**: the samlest and largest observations in the dataset

-   **Sample range**: the difference between the sample maximum and the sample minimum

## Quantiles

-   Cutpoints dividing the data into equal-sized groups (tertiles, quartiles, quintiles, percentiles, etc.)

-   First quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) cut off the bottom and top 25%, respectively

-   **Interquartile range** (IQR): Q3-Q1; shows the width of the middle 50% of the data

-   The sample minimum, Q1, Q2 (median), Q3, and maximum are sometimes called the **five number summary**

## Outliers

-   Observations numerically distant from others (definitions vary)

-   Statistical methods robust to outliers (e.g. the median) can be used if outliers are problematic

-   Should be noted and handled carefully! (e.g. maternal ages of 11 vs 111 in a dataset)

## Standard deviation {.smaller}

-   **Sample standard deviation**: most common measure of spread, based on deviations around the mean

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

-   Population SD $\sigma$ is calculated the same way, but requires sum over everyone in the population (with $\bar{x}$ replaced by $\mu$)

-   Same units as original dataset for easier interpretation

-   Often used to express confidence (e.g. a **margin of error** for a poll being around $\pm$ 2 SD of the mean)

-   Squared deviations weight larger deviations more heavily, and so also positive and negative deviations do not cancel out

## Variance {.smaller}

-   **Sample variance**: approximately the average squared deviation from the mean

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

-   Estimate of the population variance $\sigma^2$
-   Division by $n-1$ instead of $n$ to avoid bias in small samples
    -   Don't worry about that right now, more details in a subsequent statistics class if interested

## How big are most values?

-   For a distribution of any shape, most of the data are within "average $\pm$ $k$ SDs"

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Chebyshev's inequality

-   **Chebyshev's inequality** tells us the proportion of values in the range "average $\pm$ $k$ SDs" is at least $1-\frac{1}{k^2}$
:::

## Chevychev's bounds

|       Default       |              Left               |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Average $\pm$ 2 SDs | at least $1-\frac{1}{4}$ = 75%  |
| Average $\pm$ 3 SDs | at least $1-\frac{1}{9}$ = 89%  |
| Average $\pm$ 4 SDs | at least $1-\frac{1}{16}$ = 94% |
| Average $\pm$ 5 SDs | at least $1-\frac{1}{25}$ = 96% |

-   If we know the exact distribution (coming soon), we can often calculate better bounds

-   However, these bounds hold for *any* distribution (that has a well-defined mean and variance)

## Why not always use means and SDs? {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the right-skewed distribution
mean_skewed <- mean(right_skewed_data)
sd_skewed <- sd(right_skewed_data)

# Simulate a symmetric normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation
symmetric_normal_data <- rnorm(1000, mean = mean_skewed, sd = sd_skewed)

# Create a histogram of the symmetric normal distribution without axes, axis labels, or main title
hist(right_skewed_data, breaks = 30,
     col = "darkgoldenrod3", main = " ", 
     xlab = "Value")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
hist(symmetric_normal_data, breaks = 30, ann = FALSE, col = "darkgoldenrod3")
```
:::
:::

These two distributions have the same mean and standard deviation, but are clearly very different!

-   Exploratory data analysis can help us visually see differences in two datasets that basic statistics (e.g. mean and sd) might not reveal
