## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Initial data analysis approach that summarizes main characteristics of dataset
- Often visual or in the form of basic summary statistics

## Data visualization

- The creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools available (R is popular; many systems within R for data visualization)
- Creating visualizations helps us see patterns and identify potential data quality issues
- We will focus on **ggplot2**, a component of the **tidyverse**

## ggplot2 in tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The tidyverse is a group of R packages designed for data science
-   All tidyverse packages share an underlying design philosophy
-   Data visualization package in the tidyverse
-   Inspired by *The Grammar of Graphics* (Wilkinson)

## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

-   A system allowing for concise description of graphical components

![](images/lec-2/gg.png){width="300"}

## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

A statistical graphic is

-   data (which may be statistically summarized or transformed)
-   **mapped** to **aesthetic** attributes (color, size, xy-position, etc.)
-   using **geometries** (points, lines, bars, etc.)
-   mapped onto a specific **coordinate** and/or **facet** system

# Types of data

## Categorical data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Nominal data

- Named categories without numeric meaning
- Ex: Only two categories: binary or dichotomous
- Ex: breast cancer status, blood type, health insurance provider type, education level, etc
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal data

- Ordered categories, but differences between values not easily measured
- Relative comparisons made about differences between levels
- Stage of colon cancer, Likert scale, frequency of smoking (often, sometimes, rarely, never), etc. 

:::
:::


## Numerical data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Count or rank data

- Discrete counts. Or ranks.
- Number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past week, numerical rank of cancers by mortality, etc.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Continuous data

- Measurable quantities where difference between possible values can be arbitrarily small
- Data may lie within a range or be unbounded
- Birth weight, BMI, ppm ozone, etc.

## Identifying data types

![](images/lec-2/tab1.png){width="850"}

## Complications

In designing a study, what variable should we use for smoking exposure?

-   Binary variable yes/no?
-   Ordinal current/former/never smoker?
-   Discrete number of cigarettes smoked in past week?
-   Continuous measurement of lifetime pack-years?

In the real world, decisions are made based on sample size, statistical power, likelihood of measurement error, or simply convenience (this happens a lot!)



## Visualizing CDC data

Let's take a look at some basic visualizations using state-level data collected by CDC. We'll examine the following variables:

-   State (categorical; nominal)
-   HDI (categorical; ordinal)
-   Region (categorical; nominal)
-   Adult obesity % (numerical; continuous)
-   Adequate aerobic activity % (numerical; continuous)

## Bar charts

```{r}
cdc <- read.csv("https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")

# write.csv(cdc, "C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  count(Region) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Region, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "salmon2") +
  ggtitle("The South has the largest number of states")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes numerical variable by categories
-   Visually depict frequency distributions for nominal or ordinal data
-   Bars represent either frequency or relative frequency by category
-   Separation between bars (non-continuous data)
-   May contain error bars to indicate estimate variability
:::
:::

## Box plots

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x=HDI, y = Obesity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Lower HDIs associated with higher obesity %")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes numerical variable
-   Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum
-   Outliers
-   Spread and skew
-   (More on all these later!)
:::
:::

## Histograms

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Obesity)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "deeppink4", 
                 fill = "goldenrod2",
                 bins = 20) +
  ggtitle("Most states have approx. 30% adult obesity")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes numerical variable
-   Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum
-   Outliers
-   Spread and skew
-   (More on all these later!)
:::

## Line plots

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  filter(State %in% c("California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = InfantMortalityRate, group_by = State)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Infant mortality rate by State")

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes numerical variable (most often used across time)
-   Each value on x-axis corresponds to only one measurement on y-axis (and vice versa)
-   Often used to depict change over time and connected with line.

::: {.callout-warning title="Question"}
Is the plot on the left useful?
:::
:::

## Scatterplots

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Exercise, y = Obesity)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ HDI) +
  ggtitle("Adequate aerobic activity associated with lower obesity") +
  xlab("Adequate aerobic activity (%)")

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Shows relationship between multiple continuous measurements

-   You can add color, shape, transparency, etc to further differentiate by category
:::
:::

## Some best practices

-   Keep it simple
-   Summarize and highlight
-   Tell a story with the plot (use "active titles")
-   If possible, replace text with visuals

## Recap


-   Exploratory data analysis: initial data analysis that summarizes key aspects of data
-  Types of data: categorical, numerical
- Examples of plots: bar charts, box plots, histograms, etc.
