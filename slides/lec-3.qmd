## What's the use of probability?

-   Last time: how descriptive statistics are used to **describe** data
-   Goal: Make **inferences** about a population based on a sample
    -   Inference: making conclusions about a population based on a sample of data drawn from that population
-   To do this, we need a solid foundation of probability theory

## Probabilities come up all the time

How do we interpret the following statements?

-   There is a moderate chance of drought in North Carolina during the next year
-   The surgery has a 50-50 probability of success
-   The ten-year survival probability of invasivs breast cancer among US women is 83%.

## Interpretations of probability

-   Long-run frequencies vs. degree of belief

## Probability spaces {.smaller}

Mathematical objects that model **random experiments**, real-world processes involving states that occur **randomly**

A probability space consists of three components:

1.  A **sample space**, the set of all possible outcomes

2.  Subsets of the sample space, called **events**, which comprise any number of possible outcomes (including none of them!)

3.  A function that assigns **probabilities** to events

An event **occurs** if the outcome of the random experiment is contained in that event.

## Sample spaces

Sample spaces depend on the random experiment in question

-   Tossing a single fair coin
-   Tossing two fair coins
-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice
-   Survival (years) after cancer diagnosis

What is the sample space of tossing three fair coins?

## Events {.smaller}

Subsets of the sample space that comprise possible outcomes. Essentially, these are all the 'plausibly reasonable' events we're interested in calculating probabilities for\*:

-   Tossing a single fair coin
-   Tossing two fair coins
-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice
-   Survival (years) after cancer diagnosis\*

\*Note: there is some complicated math involved in calculating this. Don't worry about it for now!

Examples on the next slide...

## Events {.smaller}

Subsets of the sample space that comprise possible outcomes. Essentially, these are all the 'plausibly reasonable' events we're interested in calculating probabilities for:

-   Tossing a single fair coin
    -   A head
-   Tossing two fair coins
    -   At least one head
-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice
    -   An odd number
-   Survival (years) after cancer diagnosis
    -   More than 1 year

## Probabilities {.smaller}

A number describing the likelihood of each event's occurrence. This maps events to a number between 0 and 1, inclusive:

-   Tossing a single fair coin

    -   A head [0.5]{style="color: orange"}

-   Tossing two fair coins

    -   At least one head [0.75]{style="color: orange"}

-   Sum of rolling two fair six-sided dice

    -   An odd number [0.5]{style="color: orange"}

-  Survival (years) after cancer diagnosis

    - greater than one year [...difficult]{style="color: orange"}

## How did we come up with those answers?

- For the first three, you would probably intuit your way through using a [discrete probability distribution]{style="color: RosyBrown"} (more onthis in a few lectures)

- For the last one, by making some assumptions on the survival process, we can use similar probability tools to arrive at an answer. (But it's still complicated!)

## Events as (sub)sets

Remember, events are subsets of the entire sample space. Let's take for now the example of tossing a single fair coin and recording the outcome. 

There are only two elements in the outcome space:

- $A$: getting a head
- $B$: getting a tail

We can define the simple events of just $A$ or $B$ occurring, but are there "other" events we can define?

## Set operations {.smaller}

Sets can be related to each other in different ways. For two sets (or events) $A$ and $B$, the most common relationships are:

- [Intersection]{style="color: RosyBrown"} ($A \cap B$): $A$ and $B$ both occur
- [Union]{style="color: RosyBrown"} ($A \cup B$): $A$ or $B$ occur (including when both occur)
- [Complement]{style="color: RosyBrown"} ($A^C$): $A$ does not occur
- [Difference]{style="color: RosyBrown"} ($A \backslash B$): $A$ occurs, but $B$ does not occur; equivalent to ($A \cap B^C$) (why?)

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be [disjoint]{style="color: RosyBrown"} if $A \cap B = \emptyset$

## Those "other" events

What are the intersection, union, complement, and difference of events $A$ (getting a head) and $B$ (a tail) as applied to our coin-toss example? Are the two events $A$ and $B$ disjoint?

What are the probabilities assigned to those events:

- $P(A \cap B)=$?
- $P(A \cup B)=$?
- ...etc.

# How to probabilities "work"?

Komolgorov axioms

1. The probability of any event in the sample space is a non-negative real number (could be zero!)

2. The probability of the entire sample space is 1

3. If $A$ and $B$ are [disjoint]{style="color: RosyBrown"} events ([mutually exclusive]{style="color: RosyBrown"}), then the probability of $A$ or $B$ occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities that they occur

## How to probabilities "work"?

For two events $A$ and $B$ with probabilities $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ of occurring, the Kolmogorov axioms give us two important rules:

- [Complement Rule]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $(A^C) = 1- P(A)$
- [Inclusion-Exclusion]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

How do we extend inclusion-exclusion to more than two events?

## DeMorgan's laws

- [Complement of union]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $(A\cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C$
- [Complement of intersection]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $(A\cap B)^C = A^C \cap B^C$ 

How do we interpret these in plain English?

How do we extend DeMorgan's laws to more than two events?
