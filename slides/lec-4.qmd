## Supplemental Reading

These readings are optional. All material in homework and exams will be covered in lecture and lab, and books do not cover everything we do in lecture (even if there is a corresponding section). 

However, for those with the very optional textbooks, the following sections correspond to today's lecture:

- Pagano and Gavreau: Sections 6.2, 6.3
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/go/?id=os4_for_screen_readers&referrer=/book/os/index.php): Section 3.2

## Overview

- Introduction to conditional probability
- Bayes' Rule

## Conditional probability

The probability an event will occur when another event has already occurred. The [conditional probability]{style="color: RosyBrown"} of event $A$ given event $B$ is

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Examples come up all the time in the real world:

- Given that a mammogram comes back positive, what is the probability that a woman has breast cancer?
- Given that a 68-year old man has suffered four previous heart attacks, what is the probability he dies in the next five years?
- Given that a patient has a mutation in the CFTR gene, what is the probability their offspring will have cystic fibrosis?

## Independence and the multiplicative rule {.smaller}

We can rewrite the definition of conditional probability:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \implies  \underbrace{P(A\cap B) = P(A | B) \times P(B)}_{\text{Multiplicative Rule}}$$

What does the multiplicative rule mean in plain English?

Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be [independent]{style="color: RosyBrown"} when 

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

or equivalently, $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or $P(B|A) = P(B)$

## Independent vs. disjoint events

- Since for two independent events $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or $P(B|A) = P(B)$, knowing that one event has occurred tells us nothing more about the probability of the other occurring. 

- For two disjoint events $A$ and $B$, knowing that one has occured tells us that the other definitely has not occurred: $P(A \cap B) = 0$. 

## The law of total probability

- Suppose we partition $B$ into mutually disjoint events $B_1, B_2, \ldots B_k$ that comprise the entire sample space. Then the [law of total probability]{style="color: RosyBrown"} states that the probability of event $A$ is 
$$\begin{align}
P(A) &= P(A \cap B_1) + P(A \cap B_2) + \cdots + P(A \cap B_k) \\
 &= P(A|B_1) P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) + \cdots + P(A | B_k)P(B_k)
\end{align}$$

How did we get the last equality?

## Bayes' rule

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

- We can use [Bayes' rule]{style="color: RosyBrown"} to "reverse" the order of conditioning. 

- By definition:

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

## Bayes' rule

- Using the definition of conditional probability, the law of total probability, and the multiplicative rule, we have

$$\begin{align}
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} &= \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \\
 &= \frac{P(B | A) P(A) }{P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^C) P(A^C)}
\end{align}$$

## Illustrating Bayes' rule {.smaller}

Note: $A$ is hypothesis and $B$ is data:

$$P(A | B) =  \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} = P(B | A ) \times \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$$

To illustrate:

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{cancer given} \\
& \text{a positive} \\
& \text{mammogram}
\end{align}
\right) =$
$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{a positive mam-} \\
& \text{mogram among} \\
& \text{cancer patients}
\end{align}
\right) = \frac{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of} \\  &\text{having breast cancer)} \end{align}}{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of a} \\ &\text{positive mammogram)} \end{align}}$

## Conditional probability reminder {.smaller}

[Example 1: President of the United States]{style="color: LightSlateGrey"}

Bayes' rule is the inverse probability theorem, $P(A | B)$ vs. $P(B | A)$

*Important*: These are not the same! Define the events:

- $A$: person is the President of the United States
- $B$: person is male-identifying

$$\implies P(B | A) = 1, \quad P(A | B) \approx 0$$

## Exercise

How would you say these statements in plain English?

## Conditional probability reminder {.smaller}

[Example 2: Calculating the probability of selecting 2 aces from an ordinary deck of cards]{style="color: LightSlateGrey"}

- We're going to select 2 cards and we need an ace both times. 

- Getting an ace on the first card is 4 out of 52. 

- Since one ace is then gone from the deck, the deck now contains 51 cards, 3 of which are aces. 

- So it's 3 out of 51 for an ace on the second card. 

- The answer is therefore $4/52$ times $3/51$.

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{cancer given} \\
& \text{a positive} \\

\end{align}
\right)=$
$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{a positive mam-} \\
& \text{mogram among} \\
& \text{cancer patients}
\end{align}
\right) \times \frac{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of} \\  &\text{having breast cancer)} \end{align}}{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of a} \\ &\text{positive mammogram)} \end{align}}$

1. The probability of having breast cancer: this represents our prior knowledge about the background disease rate of breast cancer among women in their forties at the time they get a mammogram, 40/10,000 (prevalence)

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{a positive mam-} \\
& \text{mogram among} \\
& \text{cancer patients}
\end{align}
\right) \times \frac{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of} \\  &\text{having breast cancer)} \end{align}}{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of a} \\ &\text{positive mammogram)} \end{align}}$

2. The probability of a breast cancer patient getting a positive mammogram: according to NCI, 32/40 (sensitivity).

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\

\right) \times \frac{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of} \\  &\text{having breast cancer)} \end{align}}{\begin{align} & \text{(Probability of a} \\ &\text{positive mammogram)} \end{align}}$

3. The probability of getting a positive mammogram: the total number of women who get positive results include women with cancer and women who are falsely informed, 1,028/10,000 (function of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity). 


## Illustrating Bayes' rule

$\left( 
\begin{align}
& \text{Probability of} \\
& \text{cancer given} \\
& \text{a positive} \\
& \text{mammogram}
\end{align}
\right) = \left( \frac{32}{40}\right) \times 
\frac{\frac{40}{10,000}}{\frac{1,028}{10,000}} = \frac{32}{1,028} = 0.03$

- The probability that a woman who tests positive has breast cancer is only 3%. She has 95% chance to be disease free.

In this study, were dying and coffee drinking independent events?

- ...died, given that they were a high coffee drinker?

These are $P(High | Died)$ and $P(Died | High)$. 

Are these two probabilities the same?

- ...died, given that he was a high coffee drinker?

Let's verify our results using Bayes' rule.

## The law of total probability in action

- In an introductory statistics course, 50% of students were first years, 40% were sophomores, and 20% were upperclassmen. 

- 80% of the first years didn't give enough sleep, 40% of the sophomores didn't get enough sleep, and 10% of the upperclassmen didn't get enough sleep. 

- What is the probability that a randomly selected student in this class didn't get enough sleep? (OK to simply give the mathematical expression).
