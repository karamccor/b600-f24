## What is statistical inference (in a biostatistics context)?

A process that converts data into useful information, whereby practitioners

1.  form a question of interest
2.  collect and summarize data
3.  and interpret the results

## Identifying the population and question of interest

The \textcolor{red}{population} ${\color<2>[rgb]{1,0,1}{text1}}$ is the group we'd like to learn something about:

-   What is the prevalence of diabetes among [US adults]{style="color: RosyBrown"}, and has it changed over time?

-   Is there a relationship between tumor type and five-year mortality in [breast cancer patients]{style="color: RosyBrown"}?

-   Does the average amount of caffeine vary by vendor in [12 oz cups of coffee at UNC coffee shops]{style="color: RosyBrown"}?

If we had data from every unit in the population, we could just calculate what we wanted and be done!

## Sampling from the population

Unfortunately, we (usually) have to settle with a [sample]{style="color: RosyBrown"} from the population.

-   Ideally, the sample is [representative]{style="color: RosyBrown"}, allowing us to use [probability and statistical inference]{style="color: RosyBrown"} to make conclusions that are [generalizable]{style="color: RosyBrown"} to the broader population of interest.

## Sampling methods

[Probability sampling]{style="color: RosyBrown"} (e.g., simple random sampling, stratified, cluster, or multi-stage sampling)

-   All units have a known chance of being selected
-   More likely to be generalizable
-   Can be more expensive and time-consuming

[Non-probability sampling]{style="color: RosyBrown"} (e.g. quota, convenience, or snowball sampling)

-   Some units unable to be selected, with no way of knowing size or effect of sampling errors

-   Less generalizable to population of interest

-   More convenient and less costly

## Study design

[Experimental]{style="color: RosyBrown"} studies (e.g. RCTs)

-   Researchers directly control exposures or treatments

-   Ability to make causal statements

-   Less real-world applicability and generalizability

[Observational]{style="color: RosyBrown"} studies (e.g. surveys)

-   Researchers do not assign exposures or treatments

-   Real-world setting with lower burden on participants

-   Inability to prove causality

## What can go wrong?

Selection bias, reporting bias, non-response bias, attrition bias, confounding, detection bias, lack of blinding, straight-up falsified data (this happens), ...

## Course FAQ

::: incremental
-   **What background is assumed for the course?** A basic understanding of algebra and arithmetic. No previous coursework in probability and statistics is required.
-   **Will we be doing computing?** Yes. We will use R. You're welcome to check your work in another language (e.g. SAS), but homework/labs will be turned in using R.
-   **Will we learn the mathematical theory of biostatistics?** Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of biostatistics.

## Some of what you'll learn

-   Apply descriptive techniques commonly used to summarize public health data.
-   Learn methods to analyze real-world data to answer research questions in a biomedical setting.
-   Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to write reproducible reports.
-   Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.

## Reproducibility and replicability {.smaller}

-   **Reproducibility**: being able to take original data and code to reproduce all numerical findings.

-   **Replicability**: being able to independently repeat an entire study without use of the original data (generally with the same methods)

Best practices from the American Statistical Association:

-   End-to-end scripting of research
-   Use of version control and documentation (we will not use this in our class)
-   Publication of code along with data
