## Supplemental reading

These readings are optional. All material in homework and exams will be covered in lecture and lab, and books do not cover everything we do in lecture (even if there is a corresponding section). 

However, for those with the very optional textbooks, the following sections correspond to today's lecture:

- Pagano and Gavreau: Section 6.4
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/go/?id=os4_for_screen_readers&referrer=/book/os/index.php): No corresponding section

## Conditional probabilities

Suppose we care about the probability that someone has HIV, denoted by $P(HIV+)$

- What if they have a positive HIV test?

$P(HIV + | Test +)$

- What if they have a negative HIV test?

$P(HIV + | Test -)$

Knowing the result of the HIV test changes our estimate of their HIV proability.

Which of the three probabilities would we expect to be the highest? The lowest?

## Medical diagnostics

Suppose we're interested in the performance of a diagnostic test. Let $A$ be the event that someone has a condition of interest, and let $B$ be the event that a test for that condition is positive. 

- [Prevalence]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(A)$
- [Sensitivity]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(B|A)$, or the true positive rate
- [Specificity]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(B^C | A^C)$, or 1 mihnus the false positive rate
- [Positive Predictive Value]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(A|B)$
- [Negative Predictive Value]{style="color: RosyBrown"}: $P(A^C | B^C)$

What do these probabilities mean in plan English?

## Popularization of medical diagnostics {.smaller}

During COVID-19, diagnostic testing has become mainstream. 

![](images/lec-5/covid.jpg)

- Testing for COVID-19 is not perfect. It may come back positive in some people who are not infected with SARS-CoV-2 and negative in some people who are. 

- Diagnostic tests are developed with both sensitivity and specificity in mind. 

- The greater then sensitivity, the less likely it will miss real cases. 

- The greater the specificity, the more likely uninfected individuals will be correctly deemed negative. 

## A test's performance can be surprisingly counterintuitive {.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Consider a scenario with COVID-19 testing in an asymptomatic or mild population with 1 in 51 people infected. 

- Assume the test is always positive in individuals with the disease (i.e., 100% sensitivity) but falsely positive 10% of the time (i.e., 90% specificity). 

- As shown in the figure the chance that someone with a positive test result is actually infected is under 20% (1 in 6)

## Rapid self-administered HIV tests

From the FDA package insert for the OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody test, 

- Sensitivity, $P(Test+|HIV+)$: 99.3%

- Specificity, $P(Test - | HIV -)$: 99.8%

From CDC statistics for 2016, 14.3/100,000 Americans aged $\geq$ 13 are HIV+. 

Suppose a randomly selected American aged $\geq$ 13 has a positive test on this test. What do you think is the probability they are HIV+?

## Bayes' rule {.smaller}

Using the law of total probability, we have

$$\begin{align}
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} &= \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \\
 &= \frac{P(B | A) P(A) }{P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^C) P(A^C)}
\end{align}$$

Let $A$ be the event of being HIV+ and $B$ be testing positive,

$$P(HIV + | Test +) = \frac{P(Test + | HIV +)P(HIV +)}{P(Test + | HIV +) P(HIV +) + P(Test + | HIV - ) P(HIV -)}$$

## Back to OraQuick...

Suppose a randomly selected American aged $\geq$ 13 has a positive test on this test. What do you think is the probability they are HIV+?

- Is this calculation surprising?
- What is the explanation?
- Is this calculation reasonable to perform?
- What if a randomly selected adult in Botswana tested positive (HIV prevalence $\approx$ 25%)?

## Discrimination thresholds

Oral HIV tests give positive or negative results depending on levels of HIV antibodies detected in saliva. 

- If antibody levels are above a certain threshold, it is classified as a positive test.
- Varying the threshold for a positive vs. negative test will result in a test in different characteristics. 

- At each threshold value, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.

- How might you suggest an HIV diagnostic rule that has 100% sensitivity? Specificity?

## ROC curves

Receiver Operating Characteristic curves show how specificity and sensitivity change as the discrimination threshold changes. 

- The ROC curve was first developed by electrical and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields, starting in 1941. 

## Plotting true vs. false positive rates {.smaller}

- The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate (how do these relate to sensitivyt and specificity?)

- It shows the diagnostic ability of *binary* classifiers.

- That is, suppose we have a continuous variable, and we classify a patient as being positive or negative based on a threshold value of that continuous variable. 
  - e.g. start with continuous age, then classify as either Over 65 or $\leq$ 65.
  
- Let's draw an example - in which are of the plot would a "good" classifier lie?

## An illustration

To take a concrete example, HIV testing using ELISA measures the level of HIV antibodies in an individual's blood. 

- If a patient has high levels of HIV antibodies, they are likely to have HIV, and a test should classify them as being positive. 

- But what is this threshold of "high" antibody level at which to classify a patient as HIV positive or negative?

- This is where the ROC curve comes in. 

- ROC curves show, for each false positive rate, what the true positive rate is corresponding to that threshold value. 

- Let's draw an example.
