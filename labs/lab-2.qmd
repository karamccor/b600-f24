Due Friday, Aug 30 at 5pm.

For today's lab, we'll be working through a data visualization with the CDC data.

To illustrate, let's load a dataset. Enter the following command into the console (you can directly copy/paste it, but make sure everything is exactly as below):

```{r echo = T}
# temporary
cdc <- read.csv("https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")

# what it should eventually be once I get the website up
# cdc <- read.csv("https://karamccor.github.io/b600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")
```
