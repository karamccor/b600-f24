Your TAs will guide you through the first portion of the lab (until the \"On your own\" section).**\n\n## Installation\n\nR is a statistical programming language used for computation, data analysis, and graphics generation. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and applied researchers in many fields.\n\n### Benefits of R\n\n-   flexible and freely available to the public, who have in turn written many user-contributed **packages** which provide additional functionality.\n\n-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R that adds convenient features, such as exporting output in nice formats.\n\n-   In this class, we'll be doing all of our computation in RStudio.\n\nLet's begin by installing R and RStudio. First, we need to install R, which can be [downloaded here](https://cran.r-project.org/) (see screenshot below).\n\n![](images/lab-1/r1.png)\n\nNext, install RStudio Desktop, which can be [downloaded here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (see screenshot below).\n\n![](images/lab-1/r2.png)\n\n## First Steps in RStudio\n\nWith R and RStudio installed, we'll begin by exploring RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Upon opening RStudio, you should see something similar to the window below:\n\n![](images/lab-1/r3.png)\n\nThe **console** is the panel on the left side, and is where users can type commands and see immediate output. Let's try it out! Type the following code into the console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 + 5\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou should get output that looks like\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(For now, ignore the `[1]`). By typing in `3+5`, we got the expected answer, `8`. We can see that R can be used as a calculator directly in the console. Try some other commands that use R as a calculator. For instance, `3*25`, `exp(2)`, or `(10+5^2)/sqrt(40)`. Of course, R is not simply a calculator; other commands may also be entered here.\n\nTo illustrate, let's load a dataset. Enter the following command into the console (you can directly copy/paste it, but make sure everything is exactly as below):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncdc <- read.csv(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe've just loaded a dataset named `cdc`. These data come primarily from the Sortable Risk Factors and Health Indicators dataset from the CDC, which comprises demographic and health indices compiled from various federal sources. This dataset is now part of our **environment**, which is displayed on the top half and right side of the RStudio window.\n\n-   The environment contains all objects in the current working space. These objects could be variables, lists of variables, or even entire datasets.\n\n-   In the same location as the environment tab, the \\*\\*history tab displays all commands used during the current session (don't worry about the connections tab for now).\n\n-   Finally, the bottom half of the right-hand panel shows information regarding files on your hard drive, installed packages, output such as plots, and help files or other documents.\n\nComing back to the dataset we loaded in, we can see that it is named `cdc`. We can take a look at this dataset in a spreadsheet-like window by clicking on `cdc` in the Environment tab to the right, or by running the following code **in the console**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(cdc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that other objects may be added to the environment, either from external data sources from the internet as in todayâ€™s example, datasets downloaded to your computer, or even as created as manipulations of existing datasets.\n\n## R Markdown and reproducible research\n\nR Markdown is a system that may be used to create easy-to-write, attractive reports, presentations, or webpages that also serve as reproducible records of the data analysis. These reports have the desirable property of being able to not only display written narratives and figures, but also include any R code and the outputs from these code snippets.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of R Markdown is that everything is in one place, and that other users should be able to reproduce your results exactly, if they have your R Markdown document and datasets - the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render the document. As well, formatting is easy! Luckily, RStudio already comes with R Markdown support, so there is nothing additional to install.",
