No previous coursework in probability and statistics is required.\n-   **Will we be doing computing?** Yes. We will use R. You're welcome to check your work in another language (e.g. SAS), but homework/labs will be turned in using R.\n-   **Will we learn the mathematical theory of biostatistics?** Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of biostatistics.\n:::\n\n## Some of what you'll learn\n\n-   Apply descriptive techniques commonly used to summarize public health data.\n-   Learn methods to analyze real-world data to answer research questions in a biomedical setting.\n-   Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to write reproducible reports.\n-   Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.\n\n## Reproducibility and replicability {.smaller}\n\n-   **Reproducibility**: being able to take original data and code to reproduce all numerical findings.\n\n-   **Replicability**: being able to independently repeat an entire study without use of the original data (generally with the same methods)\n\nBest practices from the American Statistical Association:\n\n-   End-to-end scripting of research\n-   Use of version control and documentation (we will not use this in our class)\n-   Publication of code along with data\n\n## The current replication crisis\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/lec-1/drip.png){fig-alt=\"Former Harvard stem cell researcher up to 18 retractions\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/lec-1/duke.png){fig-alt=\"Duke agrees to pay $112 million to settle false claims related to scientific misconduct\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
