We'll examine the following variables:\n\n-   State (categorical; nominal)\n-   HDI (categorical; ordinal)\n-   Region (categorical; nominal)\n-   Adult obesity % (numerical; continuous)\n-   Adequate aerobic activity % (numerical; continuous)\n\n## Bar charts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"font-size: 70%;\"}\n-   Summarizes numerical variable by categories\n-   Visually depict frequency distributions for nominal or ordinal data\n-   Bars represent either frequency or relative frequency by category\n-   Separation between bars (non-continuous data)\n-   May contain error bars to indicate estimate variability\n:::\n:::\n\n## Box plots\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"font-size: 70%;\"}\n-   Summarizes numerical variable\n-   Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum\n-   Outliers\n-   Spread and skew\n-   (More on all these later!)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Histograms\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"font-size: 70%;\"}\n-   Summarizes numerical variable\n-   Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum\n-   Outliers\n-   Spread and skew\n-   (More on all these later!)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Line plots\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"font-size: 70%;\"}\n-   Summarizes numerical variable (most often used across time)\n-   Each value on x-axis corresponds to only one measurement on y-axis (and vice versa)\n-   Often used to depict change over time and connected with line.\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Question\"}\nIs the plot on the left useful?\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Scatterplots\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"font-size: 70%;\"}\n-   Shows relationship between multiple continuous measurements\n\n-   You can add color, shape, transparency, etc to further differentiate by category\n:::\n:::\n\n## Some best practices\n\n-   Keep it simple\n-   Summarize and highlight\n-   Tell a story with the plot (use \"active titles\")\n-   If possible, replace text with visuals\n\n## Reminder: the population vs. a sample {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n- **Population and research question**: Is the PCV13 vaccine effective against community acquired pneumonia in **adults aged 65 or older**?\n\n- Sample: 84,496 adults 65 years of age or older recruited in a trial between September 2008 and January 2010 and 101 sites throughout the Netherlands. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](images/lec-2/poly.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Parameters and statistics \n\n**Statistics**\n\n- Attribute of a sample\n- Function of the observed values at hand\n- Confusingly, both the function and the values\n  - Example: You take a measurement from a sample of 100 people. The mean measurement of that sample (as a function) is a statistic. The actual realized value of the mean measurement of that sample is also a statistic. \n- Written in Roman letters\n\n## Parameters and statistics\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- Attribute of the population of interest\n- Not computable directly (unless entire population is perfectly measured)\n- Written in Greek letters\n\nA statistic used to estimate a population parameter is an **estimator**\n\n## Numerical summary statistics {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n- Population **parameter** of interest: vaccine efficacy among all adults aged 65 or older\n\n- Sample **statistic** collected: proportion of vaccinated adults in the trial who became ill with community-acquired pneumonia\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](images/lec-2/poly.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Mean {.smaller}\n\n- **Sample mean**: the arithmetic average of values in the sample:\n\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}(x_1 + \\ldots + x_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$\n\n- Population mean $\\mu$ is calculated the same way, but would involve sum over every observation in the population (rarely possible!)\n\n- The sample mean is a **point estimate** of the population mean\n- Not the exact population mean (unless lucky), but for a representative sample, it's a pretty good guess\n\n- As the sample size gets larger, on average $\\bar{x}$ gets closer and closer to $\\mu$\n\n## Median\n\n- **Sample median**: the $50^{th}$ **percentile**\n- Middle number of observations after being ranked in numerical order\n- For odd number observations, it is the exact middle value; otherwise, it is the arithmetic average of the middle two. \n- Example: What is the median of $\\{3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9\\}$ ?\n\n- More **robust** to extreme values or outliers when compared to the mean. \n\n\n## Mode\n\n- **Sample mode**: the most frequent value in the dataset\n- There does not only have to be one mode (we can have bimodal or trimodal or other **multimodal** distributions)\n- Example: What is the mode of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 9\\}$?\n\n## Are point estimates of location enough?\n\n![](images/lec-2/irma.png){width=700}\n\n## Skewness\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Skewed** distributions are not symmetric; they can be right or left skewed depending on which side the \"tail\" is on.\n\n\n## Minimum, maximum, and range\n\n- **Sample minimum** and **maximum**: the samlest and largest observations in the dataset\n\n- **Sample range**: the difference between the sample maximum and the sample minimum\n\n## Quantiles\n\n- Cutpoints dividing the data into equal-sized groups (tertiles, quartiles, quintiles, percentiles, etc.)\n- First quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) cut off the bottom and top 25%, respectively\n\n- **Interquartile range** (IQR): Q3-Q1; shows the width of the middle 50% of the data\n\n- The sample minimum, Q1, Q2 (median), Q3, and maximum are sometimes called the **five number summary**\n\n## Outliers\n\n- Observations numerically distant from others (definitions vary)\n\n- Statistical methods robust to outliers (e.g. the median) can be used if outliers are problematic\n\n- Should be noted and handled carefully! (e.g. maternal ages of 11 vs 111 in a dataset)\n\n## Standard deviation {.smaller}\n\n- **Sample standard deviation**: most common measure of spread, based on deviations around the mean\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n\n- Population SD $\\sigma$ is calculated the same way, but requires sum over everyone in the population (with $\\bar{x}$ replaced by $\\mu$)\n\n- Same units as original dataset for easier interpretation\n\n- Often used to express confidence (e.g. a **margin of error** for a poll being around $\\pm$ 2 SD of the mean)\n- Squared deviations weight larger deviations more heavily, and so also positive and negative deviations do not cancel out\n\n\n## Variance {.smaller}\n\n- **Sample variance**: approximately the average squared deviation from the mean\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$$\n\n- Estimate of the population variance $\\sigma^2$\n- Division by $n-1$ instead of $n$ to avoid bias in small samples\n  - Don't worry about that right now, more details in a subsequent statistics class if interested\n  \n## How big are most values?\n\n- For a distribution of any shape, most of the data are within \"average $\\pm$ $k$ SDs\"\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Chebyshev's inequality\n\n- **Chebyshev's inequality** tells us the proportion of values in the range \"average $\\pm$ $k$ SDs\" is at least $1-\\frac{1}{k^2}$\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Chevychev's bounds\n\n| Default   | Left     | \n|:---------:|:--------:|\n| Average $\\pm$ 2 SDs      | at least $1-\\frac{1}{4}$ = 75%   |\n| Average $\\pm$ 3 SDs      | at least $1-\\frac{1}{9}$ = 89%   |\n| Average $\\pm$ 4 SDs      | at least $1-\\frac{1}{16}$ = 94%   |\n| Average $\\pm$ 5 SDs      | at least $1-\\frac{1}{25}$ = 96%   |\n\n- If we know the exact distribution (coming soon), we can often calculate better bounds\n\n- However, these bounds hold for *any* distribution (that has a well-defined mean and variance)\n\n## Why not always use means and SDs? {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThese two distributions have the same mean and standard deviation, but are clearly very different!\n\n- Exploratory data analysis can help us visually see differences in two datasets that basic statistics (e.g. mean and sd) might not reveal\n\n\n## Recap\n\n\n-   Exploratory data analysis: initial data analysis that summarizes key aspects of data\n-  Types of data: categorical, numerical\n- Examples of plots: bar charts, box plots, histograms, etc.\n- Population vs. sample\n- Numerical summary statistics: mean, median, mode\n- Quantiles, outliers, standard deviation vs. variance, Chebyshev's inequality\n",
